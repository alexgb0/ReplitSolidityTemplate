Ported by [alexgb0](https://github.com/alexgb0)

## Requirements
```yaml
Windows:
    - WSL >= 1
Linux/BSD:
    - nix-pkg
```

## Usage
Simply run `run.sh`. It will ask for __sudo__ permissions.

Then modify the `contract.sol` file. 

## Notes
1. You __MUST NOT__ change the name or move it.
2. If you are in WSL you __must__ have the files __inside WSL filesystem__.
